fastapi>=0.100.0 #fastapi installs Pydantic automatically
uvicorn[standard]>=0.23.0  #uvicorn[standard] is needed to run FastAPI server.
pydantic>=2.5.1


# fastapi>=0.100.0 automatically installs a compatible version of pydantic, so explicitly including pydantic>=2.5.1 is optional.
# uvicorn[standard] ensures you have all recommended extras (httptools, uvloop) for better performance.
# No other packages are needed based on your imports (datetime is standard library, utils.access_control is local).
